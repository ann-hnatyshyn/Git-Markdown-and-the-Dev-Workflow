### Tips
  Try experimenting with the comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `===`, etc.) in the node REPLE, which you can lanch using the 'node' command in your terminal. 

  Work on your code iteratively - that means in small pieces. 

  To help you figure out how to use `hungry` and `availableTime` inside your function, try outputting their values to the Termial as follows.

```javascript
function whatToDoForLunch(hungry,availableTime){
  console.log("hungry is", hungry);
  console.log("availableTime is",availableTime);
  }
```
